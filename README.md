## Dashboard Link:https://mavenanalytics.io/project/7790


### About This Project

The dataset contains relevant information regarding road accidents in the United Kingdom. The variables examined include accident date, number and severity of casualties, local authority district, road conditions, road type, vehicle types, and other pertinent details.

### Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive road accident dashboard encompassing data from the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard should provide valuable insights into the following key aspects:

-  Total casualties resulting from accidents during the specified period.
-  A breakdown of total casualties, including the percentage of casualties concerning accident severity and identification of the vehicle types associated        with   the highest casualties.
-  Analysis of total casualties based on the types of vehicles involved.
-  Monthly trend analysis, comparing casualties for the current and previous years.
-  Identification of road types with the highest number of casualties.
-  Distribution analysis of total casualties based on road surface conditions.
-  Investigation of the relationship between casualties and factors such as area/location and time of day (day/night).

### Approach & Tools:

-  Microsoft Excel -Data Cleaning & Transformation
-  PowerBI -Data Visualiation & Modelling

To achieve these objectives, our team performed an exhaustive descriptive analysis of the given dataset. We utilized Microsoft Excel and Power BI tools to carry out data cleaning, transformation, and ultimately create the informative dashboard.


### Dataset Overview:

The dataset encompasses a total of 300,492 accidents that occurred between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2022, resulting in 408,504 casualties. The accidents exhibit varying levels of severity, with "Slight" and "Serious" being the most prevalent categories, accounting for 343,070 and 58,431 casualties, respectively.

### Insights from Descriptive Analysis:

Junction Control:

The majority of accidents transpired on "uncontrolled" roads, with comparatively fewer casualties recorded on roads equipped with either "Authorized personnel" or "Authorized Traffic signal" controls.

Accident Severity:

A significant portion of the casualties were classified as "Slight," constituting approximately 83.98% , while a substantial number were categorized as "Serious" taking about 14.30% of the total Acciident severity."

Road Surface Conditions:

Most accidents occurred on dry road surfaces, followed by incidents during wet/damp conditions. Additionally, some accidents took place on frost/ice and snow-covered roads.

Road Type:

The primary locations for accidents were single-carriageway roads, followed by dual carriageways and one-way roads.

Speed Limit:

The speed limit of 30 mph was associated with the majority of accidents.

Urban or Rural Area:

The dataset reveals that the majority of accidents transpired in urban areas.

Vehicle Types:

Cars were involved in the majority of accidents, followed by vans and motorcycles.

Time of Day:

Accidents were spread throughout the day, with a higher occurrence during the afternoon and evening rush hours, indicating increased traffic volume during these periods.

### Recommendations for Stakeholders:

Road Safety Campaigns:

Stakeholders, such as government agencies and local authorities, can design targeted road safety campaigns to raise awareness among drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists in densely populated urban regions where accidents are most prevalent.

Intersection Improvements:

Local authorities can prioritize reviewing and enhancing uncontrolled junctions and auto traffic signal intersections to mitigate the number of accidents and improve traffic safety.

Road Maintenance and Signage:

Stakeholders responsible for road maintenance and infrastructure can focus on ensuring proper upkeep and adequate road signs, especially during adverse weather conditions, to minimize accidents.

Targeted Speed Limit Enforcement:

Local authorities should consider implementing targeted speed limit enforcement measures, especially in areas with a high occurrence of accidents in 30 mph zones, to deter speeding and enhance road safety.

Accident Investigation:

Further investigation into the circumstances of serious accidents can provide crucial insights into their root causes and help formulate targeted safety measures.

### Conclusion:

While these recommendations are based on the provided dataset, stakeholders should recognize that developing specific and actionable strategies requires a more extensive analysis of historical accident data, traffic patterns, and other relevant factors.
Collaboration between local authorities, law enforcement agencies, and road safety experts is essential to implement effective measures that can significantly reduce road accidents and improve overall road safety.
